Welcome to the **open-source API reference documentation** for Engramic! This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to integrating and utilizing Engramic’s powerful features.

For a **high-level overview** of Engramic’s capabilities, visit our [Knowledge Base](https://www.engramic.org/knowledge-base) on the website.

## Introduction to Engramic

Engramic is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system**, but it extends beyond traditional implementations in several key ways:

### **Long-Term Memory**
Engramic stores representations of responses that are **validated, relevant, and provide valuable reframing** of factual content. This ensures that information remains useful and contextually rich over time.

### **Enhanced Context Integration**
Context is **not an afterthought** but an integral part of the data ingestion and consolidation process. Engramic enhances retrieval and inference accuracy by ensuring that context enriches every stored data chunk.

### **Conceptual Combination**
Stored engrams contribute to an evolving dataset, enabling Engramic to **recall, combine, and synthesize ideas** dynamically. This fosters insight-driven responses—akin to human "aha" moments—and facilitates higher-order cognitive functions such as analysis and evaluation. Engramic is particularly effective when integrating **relevant external data and experiences**.

### **Step-Function Improvements**
Engramic achieves **incremental refinements** across the entire RAG pipeline. These improvements progressively **reduce errors** and enhance response precision.

### **A Necessary Evolution**
Engramic is **not just an incremental improvement**—it represents a fundamental evolution in how AI systems process, store, and retrieve knowledge. While **LLMs provide the foundation, they are not sufficient alone**. Engramic bridges the gap by ensuring AI models can think, recall, and adapt like a true knowledge system.
