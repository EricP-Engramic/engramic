# Engramic: Build Apps That Answer, Learn, and Remember

## What is Engramic?
Engramic is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to enhance AI applications with sophisticated context management and memory capabilities. Unlike conventional RAG implementations, Engramic goes beyond simple retrieval and response by integrating memory and learning mechanisms, enabling applications to adapt and improve over time.

## Features
- **Context Management**: Maintain and utilize contextual awareness across multiple interactions.
- **Memory Integration**: Store and recall relevant information dynamically for more natural and intelligent responses.
- **Learning Capability**: Adapt over time based on interactions and inputs.

## Development Status
We are in the earliest stages of development. While the core concepts are in place, the system is still evolving. We encourage developers and researchers to follow our progress and contribute to shaping the future of Engramic.
